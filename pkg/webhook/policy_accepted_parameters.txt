severity_limit sets the lowest threat severity of a CVE that should be rejected.
Accepted values are in this order (case-sensitive):
    Critical
    High
    Medium
    Low
    Negligible
So, if you want to allow only medium and lesser severity CVEs, you would have `"severity_limit": "High",` in that line.
This would reject any images coming in with a severity of High or Critical.

id_whitelist is a list of CVE ids that you would like to allow regardless of their severity rating.
It is going to look something like this example, depending on the number of ids you have in your list:
"id_whitelist": [
    "CVE-2005-2541",
    "CVE-2007-5686"
  ]
And if you should have no ids to whitelist, then it should look like this:
"id_whitelist": []
